üõ°Ô∏è HIDS-Toolkit ‚Äî Linux Host-based Intrusion Detection System

## üìò Overview
**HIDS-Toolkit** is a Bash-based Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) simulation for Linux environments.  
It monitors, detects, and reports suspicious activity using only **native system tools**, demonstrating how host-based detection can be implemented without third-party dependencies.

This project showcases real-world cybersecurity concepts such as:
- Resource and system monitoring  
- File integrity verification  
- User auditing  
- Process and network inspection  
- Log-based threat detection  
- Automated alerting and forensics  

## üéØ Project Mission
Develop a **modular, lightweight Linux HIDS** that performs:
- Continuous host monitoring  
- Anomaly detection  
- Forensic logging and alerting  
All powered by **Bash** and **cron automation**, using only built-in Linux utilities.

## üß† Learning Goals
This academic project was designed to strengthen:
- Advanced Linux administration and shell scripting  
- Modular Bash architecture design  
- Real-time log monitoring and alerting  
- Forensic correlation and reporting  
- Secure configuration management  
- Privacy-conscious system auditing

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Features

| **Feature** | **Description** | **Tools Used** |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **System Resource Monitoring** | Monitors CPU, RAM, and Disk usage; alerts on threshold breaches | `uptime`, `free -m`, `df -h` |
| **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)** | Detects unauthorized file changes using SHA256 hashing | `sha256sum`, `diff` |
| **User & Group Auditing** | Detects unauthorized user/group modifications | `awk`, `diff`, `/etc/passwd` |
| **Process & Network Scanning** | Flags suspicious processes and open ports | `ps aux`, `ss -tuln` |
| **Log-Based Detection** | Identifies brute-force, failed logins, root access, and sudo abuse | `grep`, `/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/log/syslog` |
| **Forensic Log Analysis** | Correlates events across multiple logs for investigations | `awk`, `grep`, `log_analyzer.sh` |
| **Automated Alerts** | Sends (or simulates) email alerts on critical findings | `email_alert.sh`, `ssmtp` |
| **Cron Automation** | Runs every 5 minutes for proactive detection | `cron`, `main_monitor.sh` |

üîí Security & Privacy Notes

No real logs or credentials are included.

All IPs and usernames are anonymized.

Credentials should be stored using environment variables or secrets managers.

.gitignore ensures config/email.conf and live reports stay private.

üß© Educational Value

This project demonstrates:

Host-based security monitoring using native Linux tools

Modular Bash scripting & automation design

Log correlation and forensic analysis principles

Alert automation and basic incident response simulation

Secure coding and configuration management awareness

üß† Future Application ‚Äî GRC & Security Engineering

This project laid the foundation for how I would apply my skills professionally in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) and Security Engineering:

üß© In Security Engineering

Threat Detection & Response Design: I can build and tune detection logic for Linux servers, focusing on system behavior baselining and alert thresholds.

Endpoint Hardening & Monitoring: Apply FIM, process auditing, and log-based detection in enterprise host monitoring frameworks (e.g., Wazuh, OSSEC, or Elastic Agent).

Automation & DevSecOps: Integrate host-security checks into CI/CD or configuration-management pipelines.

Incident Response Support: Use similar scripts to extract forensic evidence or validate security baselines during investigations.

Alert Engineering: Translate findings into actionable events for SOC pipelines or SIEM ingestion.

üß≠ In GRC / Risk Management

Control Validation: Map technical detections to frameworks like NIST 800-53, CIS Controls, and ISO 27001 Annex A (12, 13).

Compliance Automation: Adapt Bash checks to support evidence collection for compliance audits.

Policy-to-Control Mapping: Show how system-level detections align with defined organizational security controls.

Reporting & Metrics: Generate automated compliance status reports using sanitized system data.

üíº Long-Term Vision

This toolkit demonstrates my ability to bridge the gap between technical detection engineering and governance & compliance, translating operational security into measurable, reportable controls.

üßæ Source Code Availability

The complete codebase (all scripts and modules) is available on request for academic, evaluation, or professional review.
