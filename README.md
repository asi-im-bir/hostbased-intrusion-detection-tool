# üõ°Ô∏è **HIDS-Toolkit ‚Äî Linux Host-based Intrusion Detection System**

---

## üìò **Overview**
**HIDS-Toolkit** is a Bash-based Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) simulation for Linux environments.  
It monitors, detects, and reports suspicious activity using only **native system tools**, demonstrating how host-based detection can be implemented without third-party dependencies.

This project showcases real-world cybersecurity concepts such as:
- Resource and system monitoring  
- File integrity verification  
- User auditing  
- Process and network inspection  
- Log-based threat detection  
- Automated alerting and forensics  

---

## üéØ **Project Mission**
Develop a **modular, lightweight Linux HIDS** that performs:
- Continuous host monitoring  
- Anomaly detection  
- Forensic logging and alerting  

All powered by **Bash** and **cron automation**, using only built-in Linux utilities.

---

## üß† **Learning Goals**
This academic project was designed to strengthen:
- Advanced Linux administration and shell scripting  
- Modular Bash architecture design  
- Real-time log monitoring and alerting  
- Forensic correlation and reporting  
- Secure configuration management  
- Privacy-conscious system auditing

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Core Features**

| **Feature** | **Description** | **Tools Used** |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **System Resource Monitoring** | Monitors CPU, RAM, and Disk usage; alerts on threshold breaches | `uptime`, `free -m`, `df -h` |
| **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)** | Detects unauthorized file changes using SHA256 hashing | `sha256sum`, `diff` |
| **User & Group Auditing** | Detects unauthorized user/group modifications | `awk`, `diff`, `/etc/passwd` |
| **Process & Network Scanning** | Flags suspicious processes and open ports | `ps aux`, `ss -tuln` |
| **Log-Based Detection** | Identifies brute-force, failed logins, root access, and sudo abuse | `grep`, `/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/log/syslog` |
| **Forensic Log Analysis** | Correlates events across multiple logs for investigations | `awk`, `grep`, `log_analyzer.sh` |
| **Automated Alerts** | Sends (or simulates) email alerts on critical findings | `email_alert.sh`, `ssmtp` |
| **Cron Automation** | Runs every 5 minutes for proactive detection | `cron`, `main_monitor.sh` |

## üß† **Future Application ‚Äî Leveraging This Project in GRC, Audit, and Security Engineering**

This project is more than a technical demonstration ‚Äî it provides a strong foundation for how I can apply **detection engineering**, **automation**, and **risk-based control validation** in professional environments.

---

### üß© **In GRC Engineering**

- **Control Implementation Evidence:**  
  Each detection script (e.g., file integrity, user auditing) can serve as technical proof that a control exists and operates effectively, aligning with **ISO 27001 A.12/A.16**, **CIS Control 4/5**, or **NIST 800-53 SI-4 (System Monitoring)**.  

- **Continuous Compliance Monitoring:**  
  By automating these checks through `cron`, the toolkit demonstrates how compliance evidence can be collected continuously ‚Äî transforming static audits into ongoing assurance.  

- **Policy Enforcement:**  
  Bash-based checks can be tied to GRC platforms or compliance dashboards to validate adherence to security baselines and organizational standards.  

- **Audit-Ready Logging:**  
  Reports generated by the toolkit (e.g., user changes, file integrity results) mimic the type of timestamped, tamper-evident evidence auditors require for technical control reviews.  

- **Risk & Metrics Alignment:**  
  The alerting and threshold mechanisms model how technical indicators can be tied to **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)** and **security metrics** in GRC reporting.  

---

### üß≠ **In Security Engineering**

- **Detection Engineering:**  
  Build custom detection logic for host-level threats, applying the same principles to enterprise tools like **Wazuh**, **Elastic Agent**, or **Splunk**.  

- **Endpoint Hardening:**  
  Extend file integrity and process auditing into production hardening frameworks and endpoint management policies.  

- **Security Automation:**  
  Integrate baseline checks into **CI/CD pipelines**, ensuring systems meet compliance controls before deployment.  

- **Incident Response:**  
  Use log correlation and forensic modules to support audit investigations and post-incident reviews.  

- **Alert Engineering:**  
  Convert findings into **SIEM-ready alerts**, providing visibility and measurable evidence of proactive defense.  

---

### üìã **In IT Audit & Risk Assurance**

- **Evidence Collection Automation:**  
  Replace manual audit samples with automated data collection ‚Äî every 5-minute scan acts as real-time control evidence.  

- **Audit Trail Integrity:**  
  The use of hashing (`sha256sum`) and timestamped logs models secure audit trail practices and non-repudiation.  

- **Control Effectiveness Validation:**  
  The toolkit provides a method to **test and verify** whether preventive and detective controls (e.g., password policy, unauthorized access alerts) are functioning as intended.  

- **Gap Analysis & Remediation:**  
  Findings from these scans can directly feed into risk registers and remediation plans during audit cycles.  

- **Integration with Governance Frameworks:**  
  The logic can be extended to support continuous control monitoring frameworks (CCM) or integrated GRC tools (e.g., ServiceNow GRC, Archer, or LogicGate).
